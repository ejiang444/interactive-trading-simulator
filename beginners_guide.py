            A stock represents ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you become a partial owner of that company.

            Key Points:
            - Each share equals a small piece of the company.
            - Stock prices change based on supply, demand, and company performance.
            - You can profit through price appreciation or dividends.
            - Prices can go up or down – you can lose money.

        Market Order:
        - Executes immediately at current market price
        - Guaranteed execution, but price not guaranteed
        - Best for quick trades, liquid stocks, small orders
        
        Limit Order:
        - Only executes at your specified price or better
        - Price control, but may not execute
        - Best for volatile stocks, large orders, when you can wait

        - Minimize with:

    # AVOID COMMON MISTAKES
    st.markdown("""
    ### **‼️ Avoid Common Mistakes**

    - Lack of planning, including trading without a strategy or making random entries and exits, often causes unnecessary mistakes.
    - Overtrading by making too many trades too frequently can also harm your results.
